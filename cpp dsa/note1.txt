what is a subsequence ?
so subsequence is a contigous or non contigous sequence which follows a the order 
eg:so lets say this is a na arrray 
[3,1,2] : possible subsequence ={3,1,2,{3,1},{3,1,2},{1,2},{3,2}} but it can never be {2,3} as it does not follow the order here

subsequnce could be find using 
1.Power set // algo for printing subsequence
2.recursion
